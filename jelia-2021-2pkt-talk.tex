\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Context}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We live in the \alert{data-driven AI} era
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item pervasive need of processing wide amounts of data
            \item[eg] coming form sensors, smart devices, social networks etc.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \bigskip
        
        \item Stream processing is the preferred way towards \alert{scalability}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item streams as possibly \alert{unlimited FIFO queues} of data
            \item either \emph{cold} (a.k.a. \alert{pull}) or \emph{hot} (a.k.a. \alert{push}) depending data \alert{generation}
            \item processing does not require loading \emph{all} data in memory
            \item support for \alert{lazy} manipulation of data
        \end{itemize}
        
        \framebreak
        
        \item Main-stream programming languages are blending FP with OOP
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[$\rightarrow$] cascades of higher-order functions as stream-processing pipelines
            \item[eg] map, flat map, filter, fold, reduce, etc 
        \end{itemize}
        
        \bigskip
        
        \item Plenty of technologies for stream processing \alert{in the large}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item featuring advancend, time-related operators 
            \item[eg] Kafka, Flink, Spark, Storm, etc.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}
    \begin{block}{Question 1}
        \centering
        What is the role of LP in stream processing?
    \end{block}
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LP as a means to express \alert{complex event processing} \ccite{AnicicFRSSS10,AnicicRFS12}
        \item \alert{ASP} as a means to reason over \emph{hot} streams \ccite{BeckEB17,Beck2018}
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill

    \begin{block}{Question 2}
        \centering
        What is the role of \emph{Prolog} in stream processing?
    \end{block}
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\uparrow$] this is the focus of this work

\begin{frame}{Contributions of this Work}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We discuss why Prm olog \emph{already} supports lazy stream manipulation
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item as Prolog solvers can be intended as \alert{prosumers} of data
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill
        
        \item We propose a notion of \alert{generator} aimed letting solvers:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item lazily consume streams of data from the external world
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill  
        
        \item We sketch \alert{state-machine-based} design for Prolog solvers
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item aimed at supporting the aforementioned notion of \alert{generator}
            \item without affecting its syntax, nor its semantics
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill  

        \item We demonstrate how generators can be exploited in practice
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[eg] letting Prolog invoke external solvers and lazily consume their responses
            \item via the \twopkt{} technology \ccite{homepage2PKt}
        \end{itemize}
