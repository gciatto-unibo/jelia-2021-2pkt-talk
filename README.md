# Lazy Stream Manipulation in Prolog via Backtracking: The Case of 2P-Kt (Talk @ JELIA 2021)

by Giovanni Ciatto, Roberta Calegari, Andrea Omicini

## Abstract

The ability to lazily manipulate long or infinite streams of data is an essential feature in the era of data-driven artificial intelligence. Yet, logic programming technologies currently fall short when it comes to handling long or infinite streams of data. In this paper, we discuss how Prolog can be reinterpreted as a stream processing tool, and re-designed around an abstract state-machine capable of lazily manipulating streams of data via backtracking.
